The dashboard can be used to comprehensively elucidate the current scenario of the Multistate Cooperative Societies of India.

The entities of the dashboard are as follows:

**State of Registration ![](Aspose.Words.3e341b23-41f4-4f9f-a0ba-efa55e7c7405.002.png)**

The map showcases all the states which have different societies registered within them.  

The colour ranges from light to dark, where darkest indicates the state with the maximum number of societies. 

**District where the society operates ![](Aspose.Words.3e341b23-41f4-4f9f-a0ba-efa55e7c7405.003.png)**

The darker and larger circles depict the districts with greater number of operational societies. 

**Sector Type ![](Aspose.Words.3e341b23-41f4-4f9f-a0ba-efa55e7c7405.004.png)**

The bar chart represents the sectors in which different societies operate.  

Each sector is assigned a different colour. 

The height of the bar illustrates the number of societies belonging to a sector. 

**Areas of operation ![](Aspose.Words.3e341b23-41f4-4f9f-a0ba-efa55e7c7405.005.png)![](Aspose.Words.3e341b23-41f4-4f9f-a0ba-efa55e7c7405.006.png)**
